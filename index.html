				<h1>Trichotomy UI</h1>
				<a href="https://github.com/tgv1975/trichotomy/"
				   target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>
				<hr>
				<h2>Examples</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="demo/doc/index.html">Live documentation</a></li>
					<li><a href="demo/holy-grail/index.html">Holy Grail</a></li>
					<li><a href="demo/overlay-sidebar/">Overlay Sidebar</a></li>
					<li><a href="demo/adjacent-sidebars/">Adjacent Sidebars</a></li>
				</ul>
				<h2>The Concept</h2>
				<p>We often divide things into <b>three parts</b> when we conceptualize about them.</p>
				<p>House: Foundation, storeys, roof.</p>
				<p>Tree: Roots, trunk, branches.</p>
				<p>Arbitrary stretch in space: Front, middle, back; or time: Begining, middle, end.</p>
				<p>This conceptual pattern arises even when the three parts are not readily identifiable.
					For instance, for a window opening we get the upper rail, window panes, and stool. The first and
					last elements can be easily discarded, conceptually, because the window panes are what <i>really</i> defines a
					window, but they are there nevertheless, even if mostly hidden.</p>
				<p>In UI design, there is the classic trichotomy of the interface <sup><a href="#footnotes">*</a></sup>:</p>
				<h4>Header, Center(piece), Footer</h4>
				<p>Simpler UIs have to use this pattern only once, at the top level: the app's shell, its main layout. But as the
					UI gets more complex, there arises a need to repeat this pattern, over and over. Think
					<a href="http://www.houseofwhitetie.com/reaper/imperial/wt_imperial.html"
					   target="_blank">DAW interfaces</a> that can get pretty complex.
				</p>
				<p>Therefore it would be useful to define an implementation of this concept/pattern into web design, using current
					technologies, based on these principles:
					<ol>
						<li>Most non-trivial layouts require separation into well-defined regions.</li>
						<li>Most separation can be achieved by trichotomy (the classic header-body-footer combo).</li>
						<li>Trichotomies can be composed and merged, giving the concept a fractalic nature, which obliges any
							possible implementation to remain <b>simple</b>, and gain complexity by repetition, not special cases.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				<h2>This implementation</h2>
				<p>
					It's nothing new. But it brings to the table a few advantages: utmost simplicity while retaining meaning in
					relation to the underlying concept; scalability; disregard of all else but the underlying concept, including
					prettiness - that is the concern of the frontend library you may chose for the task.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any consumer may simply import <b><a href="trichotomy.css"
						   target="_blank">trichotomy.css</a></b> and use the container
					classes (<i>.trichotomy,
						.vertical,
						.horizontal</i>) and the <i>.centerpiece</i> class. The rest takes care of itself by the magic of <b>flex</b>.
					The implementation does not rely on any framework, it's pure HTML5/CSS3. This should make it play nice with all
					frontend frameworks (Bootstrap, Semantic UI, etc.), the use of which along with this is, in fact, encouraged.
				</p>

				<h2>Caveats</h2>
				<p>Dynamic functionality, some of the actual sizing, obviously the final styling, are all the responsibility of the
					consumer.</p>

				<h2>TODO</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Define and solve horizontal overlays, which would cover the case of dynamic hiding of headers/footers.</li>
					<li>Offer build and installation instructions.</li>
					<li>More complex examples.</li>
					<li>Offer ready-made HTML templates.</li>
					<li>Complex integrations: Bootstrap 4 and Angular/React as a turnkey solution for fundamental layout needs. </li>
				</ul>
